            <h4>The Second Division of English Football</h4>
            <p>The EFL Championship is England's second division on the football pyramid. At the end of each season, 
            the top two teams are automatically promoted to the Premier League. Teams placed third to sixth compete 
            in a playoffs to earn the third promotion spot. The three lowest-finishing teams are relegated to EFL 
            League One. Included is a table of the teams competing in the EFL Championship this season and where 
            they placed last season.</p>
